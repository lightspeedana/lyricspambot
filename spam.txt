I REMEMBER WHEN IT ALL WENT WRONG
GUZZLING EGGNOG ALL NIGHT LONG
WE WENT OUTSIDE
THE SNOW WAS THICK
ROLLED OUR BALLS TOGETHER MADE A SNOWMAN QUICK
ERECTING A FRIEND BUT THERES SOMETHING LEFT
HAD TO INDULGE IN SOME CARROT THEFT
TO MAKE HIM WHOLE
WE RAIDED THE SALAD BOWL
TO GIVE HIM A CLASSIC NOSE
I SLIPPED AND FELL WHEN I PUT IT ON
STUCK THE VEG WHERE IT DIDNT BELONG
I WENT FOR HIS FACE BUT I HIT BELOW THE WAIST
AND NOW HES GOT A ROOT VEGETABLE DONG
HES GOT A CARROT FOR A COCK CARROT FOR A COCK
AND IT GIVES YOU QUITE A SHOCK OH ITS UNEXPECTED
WHEN YOU SEE IT IN THE FLESH SO ORANGE AND SO FRESH
LOOKS LIKE ITS JUST BEEN PULLED FROM THE GROUND
HES GOT A CARROT FOR A COCK CARROT FOR A COCK
ITS THE BIGGEST ON THE BLOCK OH WHAT A MASSIVE ONE
THE NEIGHBOURS WERE UPSET MY DAD SAW IT AS A THREAT
IT STOOD SO MIGHTY AND SO PROUD
SOME KIND OF MAGIC HAPPENED THEN UH OH
HE CAME ALIVE AND HE WAS REAL MY FRIEND
AN EXCITED EXPRESSION
TWINKLED IN HIS EYES
WE LOOKED ON IN SURPRISE AS IT STARTED TO RISE
SCARF AROUND HIS NECK HIS ARMS ARE MADE OF BARK
GET DOWN ON YOUR KNEES HELL HELP YOU SEE IN THE DARK
HE HAS A FILTHY ADDICTION
VEG ON VEG FRICTION
BEHIND THE BUSHES DOWN IN THE PARK
HES GOT MANY DIRTY HABITS AND ITS TERRIFIED OF RABBITS
HELL MAKE YOU MOAN HES ORGANICALLY GROWN
HES GOT A CARROT FOR A COCK CARROT FOR A COCK
YOU KNOW ITS HARD AS ROCK OH WHAT A CRUNCHY COCK
HES GOT COAL ON HIS HEAD NO MEAT BUT ONE VEG
HES PACKING SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST SNOW HO HO HO
HES GOT A CARROT FOR A COCK CARROT FOR A COCK
BUT HIS LIFES AGAINST THE CLOCK OH SUCH A CRYING SHAME
CAUSE AS THE SUN ROSE THEYD GRITTED THE ROAD
ALL WAS LEFT WAS HIS BRIGHT AMBER CHODE
YOULL REMEMBER THIS DECEMBER WHEN YOU DREAM OF HIS MEMBER
NOW ALL THATS LEFT IS HIS SALTY SLUDGE
NEXT TIME IT SNOWS YOU ALL WILL KNOW
HES COMING ON YOU FROM ABOVE
HES JUST SNOWING YOU ALL OF HIS LOVE
HE HAS A CARROT FOR A COCK CARROT FOR A COCK
HES A FRIEND YOU JUST CANT KNOCK OH WE WANT HIM BACK
SO WHEN IT GETS CHILLY JUST WHIP OUT HIS WILLY
SCOOP UP SNOW AND HES READY TO GO
THEY ALL HAVE CARROTS FOR A COCK CARROTS FOR A COCK
A MOVEMENT YOU CANT BE STOPPED ITS A REVOLUTION
TO MAKE A NEW BEST FRIEND JUST FOLLOW THIS TREND
GIVE HIM A VEGETABLE BELL END
CARROT FOR A COCK YAY

THERE WAS A TIME WHEN MEN WERE KIND
WHEN THEIR VOICES WERE SOFT
AND THEIR WORDS INVITING
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN LOVE WAS BLIND
AND THE WORLD WAS A SONG
AND THE SONG WAS EXCITING
THERE WAS A TIME
THEN IT ALL WENT WRONG
I DREAMED A DREAM IN TIMES GONE BY
WHEN HOPE WAS HIGH AND LIFE WORTH LIVING
I DREAMED THAT LOVE WOULD NEVER DIE
I DREAMED THAT GOD WOULD BE FORGIVING
THEN I WAS YOUNG AND UNAFRAID
AND DREAMS WERE MADE AND USED AND WASTED
THERE WAS NO RANSOM TO BE PAID
NO SONG UNSUNG NO WINE UNTASTED
BUT THE TIGERS COME AT NIGHT
WITH THEIR VOICES SOFT AS THUNDER
AS THEY TEAR YOUR HOPE APART
AS THEY TURN YOUR DREAM TO SHAME
HE SLEPT A SUMMER BY MY SIDE
HE FILLED MY DAYS WITH ENDLESS WONDER
HE TOOK MY CHILDHOOD IN HIS STRIDE
BUT HE WAS GONE WHEN AUTUMN CAME
AND STILL I DREAM HELL COME TO ME
THAT WE WILL LIVE THE YEARS TOGETHER
BUT THERE ARE DREAMS THAT CANNOT BE
AND THERE ARE STORMS WE CANNOT WEATHER
I HAD A DREAM MY LIFE WOULD BE
SO DIFFERENT FROM THIS HELL IM LIVING
SO DIFFERENT NOW FROM WHAT IT SEEMED
NOW LIFE HAS KILLED THE DREAM I DREAMED

BIG WHEELS KEEP ON TURNING
CARRY ME HOME TO SEE MY KIN
SINGING SONGS ABOUT THE SOUTHLAND
I MISS OLE BAMY ONCE AGAIN AND I THINK ITS A SIN
WELL I HEARD MISTER YOUNG SING ABOUT HER
WELL I HEARD OLE NEIL PUT HER DOWN
WELL I HOPE NEIL YOUNG WILL REMEMBER
A SOUTHERN MAN DONT NEED HIM AROUND ANYHOW

LET IT GO LET IT GO
YOULL NEVER SEE ME CRY
HERE I STAND AND HERE I STAY
LET THE STORM RAGE ON
MY POWER FLURRIES THROUGH THE AIR INTO THE GROUND
MY SOUL IS SPIRALING IN FROZEN FRACTALS ALL AROUND
AND ONE THOUGHT CRYSTALLIZES LIKE AN ICY BLAST
IM NEVER GOING BACK THE PAST IS IN THE PAST
LET IT GO
THE COLD NEVER BOTHERED ME ANYWAY
LET IT GO LET IT GO
AND ILL RISE LIKE THE BREAK OF DAWN
LET IT GO LET IT GO
